# UpPair
Easy to use  python tool to visualize intersection between paired groups. 

## Setup and Installation 
UpPair will be available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/) soon to be installed via `pip`

`pip install UpPair`

Alternatively, if you prefer anaconda 

`conda install UpPair`


### Example 1: Basic Plot 
- Visualize the overlap of replicate samples from the same patient sequenced separaltey

### Example 2: 
- Comparing methodologies on same sample

### Example 3: Two features stacked

### Example 4: Grouping of 3 samples. 
- Figure shows intersection of somatic mutation identified in various biopsies in the same individual

### Example 5:  
- Figure shows comparison of two methods (CTC and cfDNA) to detect somatic mutations compared with biopsy. Both methods are compared only with against biopsy (treated as gold-standard) and sensitivity and specifity is displayed. Results are compared across multiple cancer types to determine if a given method would perform better in a certain cancer type.
